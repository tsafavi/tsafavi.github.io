In the first year of my PhD (2017) I applied to several PhD fellowships and was awarded the <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/" target="_blank">NSF Graduate Research Fellowship</a>.
The GRF is a 3-year fellowship for early-stage graduate students pursuing research in STEM. 
Here I've consolidated some notes, tips, and examples, including one of my application essays, to help current and future applicants.
I try to update this page with each application cycle,  since it has been useful to a number of past applicants and winners.

## <a name="overview">Overview</a> [<a href="#top">top</a>]


If you  plan to apply for the fellowship, 
 __read the official NSF GRFP <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2019/nsf19590/nsf19590.htm" target="_blank">Program Solicitation</a>__ right away.
 The Program Solicitation is a self-contained document with all the essential information: eligibility, deadlines, how to apply, review criteria, etc.
When I was applying I didn't read the Program Solicitation until pretty late, upon which I realized the formatting of my essays was wrong.
(Brief panic ensued).
Please read it!

Your main efforts should be directed toward the two required essays:

- The __Personal, Relevant Background and Future Goals Statement__ is your "how I got here and where I'm going" personal statement. Max 3 pages.
- The __Graduate Research Plan Statement__ is a short proposal of a research project you plan to conduct. 
You don't necessarily _have_ to actually carry out this plan should you win the fellowship, but you need to demonstrate that you can pitch an impactful project, understand relevant literature, plan and evaluate the project's execution, etc. Max 2 pages.

The __most important__ part of these essays, in my opinion, is discussing _explicitly_ how you and your research fulfill the GRFP's two review criteria.
I discuss these criteria next.

### <a name="intellectual-merit">Criterion 1: Intellectual Merit</a> [<a href="#top">top</a>]


The first criterion upon which your essays will be judged is __Intellectual Merit__, which the NSF describes as the __potential to advance knowledge__---in other words, the scientific impacts made by your past, present, and future research.
Some questions to consider here are:
What scientific contributions have you made or will you make? 
What knowledge gaps is your research filling in?
How can other researchers build off your work?
What are tangible outcomes of your work, like publications or presentations?
What research-related honors (i.e., endorsements from other scientists) have you received?

- In the __Personal, Relevant Background and Future Goals Statement__, discuss the Intellectual Merits of your previous research projects in the "Relevant Background" part of the essay: novel techniques, strong experimental results, publications, presentations, awards, etc.
A concrete example: In the Intellectual Merit section of my undergraduate thesis description, I said that I turned the thesis into an (accepted) conference paper. I also mentioned one comment from the paper's reviews:
"The techniques proposed in this work are likely to be used by other researchers".
- The __Graduate Research Plan Statement__ is all about Intellectual Merit. 
In my statement, I consistently emphasized the novelty of my proposed techniques and the scientific importance of the problem itself.


### <a name="broader-impacts">Criterion 2: Broader Impacts</a> [<a href="#top">top</a>]


The second review criterion is __Broader Impacts__, which the NSF describes as __the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes__.
I think Broader Impacts is more vague than Intellectual Merit.
I interpret it as how your research-related activities go  _beyond_ academia.
I think the NSF wants Fellows who leave their academic ivory towers and interact/engage with the public.
Some questions to consider here are:
How can you make your research accessible to a broad audience?
How have you communicated, or will you communicate, your work to the public?
Who is benefiting from your research, and in what way? 

- In the __Personal, Relevant Background and Future Goals Statement__, good candidates for Broader Impacts are teaching and outreach, especially related to increasing minority participation in STEM.
Another good candidate is describing how your research has been used "in the wild" (beyond academia).
My statement's Broader Impacts was mostly about my outreach and teaching experience.
- In the __Graduate Research Plan Statement__, describe how your proposed project will impact society.
I don't think these impacts have to be 100 percent _direct_, since  most PhD research projects don't just change the world immediately.
You can also discuss how you plan to communicate the results of your work to the public.
My proposal's Broader Impacts section had a few sentences about both societal impacts and public engagement.

## <a name="my-application">Concrete examples from my application</a> [<a href="#top">top</a>]


I wrote my essays in LaTeX. 
That said,
I believe last year's Program Solicitation said that either 12-point Times New Roman or Computer Modern (the default LaTeX font) could be used, but it looks like this year's Solicitation only mentions 12-point Times New Roman.
Make sure to follow the margin, font, and other formatting requirements, as I believe they can reject you without even considering your application if you don't follow the guidelines.

- __Personal, Relevant Background and Future Goals Statement__ [<a href="/assets/pdf/nsf-personal.pdf" target="_blank">link to the PDF of my personal statement</a>]. The sections in this essay followed the structure:
  - Personal background of how I got into CS research and major highlights, like awards and publications (~half a page)
  - Relevant work, which I divided into three projects, each with their own Intellectual Merits and Broader Impacts subsections (~2 pages)
  - Broader Impacts and future goals, like outreach initiatives and applications of my work (~half a page)
- __Graduate Research Plan Statement__. I didn't include a link to my research plan because the project is still underway and not published. I'll add the link once the project is complete. 
The sections in this essay followed the structure:
  - Motivations for studying the problem and basic notation (~1/3 page)
  - Proposed approach and evaluation plan (1 page)
  - Intellectual Merit and technical contributions of the research (~1/3 page)
  - Broader (societal and outreach) Impacts that would come out of the project (~1/3 page)

Hopefully it's clear by now that you should be specific about  Intellectual Merits and Broader Impacts in your essays.
Also make sure to read the other GRFP guidelines so you don't miss any details.
Final thoughts:

- Try not to sell yourself short. A lot of graduate students suffer from imposter syndrome, but this isn't the place to show it. Your scientific value will come through best in these essays if you really emphasize it!
- Don't be afraid to use figures in your essay.
- __Bold important results, awards, and contributions__. This quickly draws the reader's attention to the important parts of your essays, which is especially helpful to reviewers who have to read many applications.
- <a href="http://www.alexhunterlang.com/nsf-fellowship" target="_blank">Alex Hunter Lang's webpage</a> is the one of the most-used resources for GRFP application tips. It also has a fairly large compilation of essays and tips from past winners in different fields. I __highly recommend reading his tips and perusing successful essays__ from previous years.
- Get lots of people to read your essays. In my opinion, the most valuable reviewers are past fellowship winners and professors who have experience writing NSF proposals.

Good luck! Feel free to reach out if you have questions related to the program.
I'm also happy to provide feedback on individual essays as long as sufficient time is given (1.5 weeks+).
